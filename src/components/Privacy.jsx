        <p>2.1 Application.</p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with respect to information
          that can be associated with or which relates to a person and/or could
          be used to identify a person ("Personal Data") that is collected from
          Users on or through the Services. This policy also covers personal
          data collected from Eventbrite sales customers and prospects. We take
          the privacy of your Personal Data seriously. Because of that, we have
          created this Privacy Policy. Please read this Privacy Policy as it
          includes important information regarding your Personal Data and other
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Non-Personal Data" as used in this Privacy Policy is therefore any
          information that does not relate to a person and/or cannot be used to
          identify a person. When you interact with the Services, we may collect
          Non-Personal Data. The limitations and requirements in this Privacy
          Policy on our collection, use, disclosure, transfer and
          storage/retention of Personal Data do not apply to Non-Personal Data.

        <h5 className="mb-1">Personal Data that we Collect.</h5>
        <p className="mb-3">
          When you use or interact with us through the Services or engage with
          Eventbrite as a sales customer or prospect, we may collect Personal
          Data. Sometimes this will be on our own behalf and other times this
          will be on behalf of an Organizer using our Services to run an event.
          This is an important distinction for purposes of certain data
          protection laws and is explained in more detail below.
        </p>
        <p>3.1 Information Collected From All Users.</p>
        <p>
          Information you provide to us: For all Users we collect Personal Data
          when you voluntarily provide such information to the Services, such as
          when you register for access to the Services, contact us with
          inquiries, respond to one of our surveys or browse or use certain
          parts of the Services. The Personal Data we may collect includes
          without limitation your name, address, email address and any other
          information that you choose to provide and/or that enables Users to be
          personally identified. Information we automatically collect: We also
          automatically collect certain technical data that is sent to us from
          the computer, mobile device and/or browser through which you access
          the Services ("Automatic Data"). Automatic Data, includes without
          limitation, a unique identifier associated with your access device
          and/or browser (including, for example, your Internet Protocol (IP)
          address) characteristics about your access device and/or browser,
          statistics on your activities on the Services, information about how
          you came to the Services and data collected through Cookies, Pixel
          Tags, Local Shared Objects, Web Storage and other similar
          technologies. You can find out more information about how we use
          Cookies and other similar tracking technologies in our Cookie
          Statement. When you register for the Services or otherwise submit
          Personal Data to us, we may associate other Non-Personal Data
          (including Non-Personal Data we collect from third parties) with your
          Personal Data. At such instance, we will treat any such combined data
          as your Personal Data until such time as it can no longer be
          associated with you or used to identify you.
        </p>
        <p>3.2 Information Collected From Organizers.</p>
        <p>
          If you are an Organizer we will collect additional Personal Data from
          you. Information you provide to us: In some cases, we may collect your
          credit card information (e.g., your credit card number and expiration
          date, billing address, etc.), some of which may constitute Personal
          Data, to secure certain payments. In addition, if you use our payment
          processing services, we will collect financial information from you
          (e.g., your bank account information or an address to send checks) as
          necessary to facilitate payments and information required for tax
          purposes (e.g., your taxpayer identification number). Information we
          obtain from other sources: We may also collect or receive Personal
          Data including your name, email address and other contact information
          from third party sources, such as third party websites and marketing
          partners, your bank, our payment processing partners and credit
          reporting agencies.
        </p>
        <p>3.3 Information Collected From Consumers.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you are a Consumer we will collect additional Personal Data from
          you, sometimes for our own purposes and other times on behalf of an
          Organizer (see Section 16 below for more information).
        </p>
        <p>
          Information you provide via Eventbrite Properties or Applications: If
          you register for a paid event, you will provide financial information
          (e.g., your credit card number and expiration date, billing address,
          etc.) some of which may constitute Personal Data. In addition,
          Organizers can set up event registration pages to collect virtually
          any information from Consumers in connection with registration for an
          Organizer's event listed on the Services. Eventbrite does not control
          an Organizer's registration process nor the Personal Data that they
          collect. When you register for, or otherwise provide information to
          Eventbrite in conjunction with an Organizer event or activity, whether
          that information is yours or a third party’s, in connection with a
          purchase, registration, or transfer, that Organizer will receive and
          may use the information you provide. Please see Section 5.5 below,
          titled “How We Disclose and Transfer Your Personal Data: Organizers”
          for more information about an Organizer’s receipt and use of your
          Personal Data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information we obtain from other sources: We may also collect or
          receive Personal Data from third party sources, such as Organizers,
          other Consumers, social media or other third party integrations, your
          credit card issuing bank, our payment processing partners or other
          third parties.
